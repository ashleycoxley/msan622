They are quite large - I gave a couple of them away already, and the guy who came to pick them up estimated that they are 10 - 20 years old.  The largest, which is still intact, has a foliage diameter of at least 6 feet, maybe more like 8.  As we discovered when we removed the small lily, the root systems are quite a bit larger than the foliage systems.  There are 3 distinct plants left - one pink lily (the largest one, mentioned above), and 2 significantly smaller ones that are dark pink.  The smaller ones came from a medium-sized plant that was split into 3 parts last week.

Here are some requirements for interested parties:

- Upper body strength.  I am giving preference to men who are interested.  I cannot physically lift these lilies out of the pond myself - I tried with a pitchfork last week and failed miserably.  HEAVY.

- Something in which to place the lilies.  The small lily that was taken last week wouldn't fit in a large Home Depot bucket - it required one of those party ice/drink tubs.  Be prepared to bring something large to hold them.  

- If it were me, I would only take them if I had a pickup truck.  There is some serious rotting funk at the bottom of our pond that has been revealed during draining, and it reeks.  You are not going to want this stuff touching your car.  

- You will probably want waders.  There is still about 12"" of water in the pond (to keep the lilies moist until somebody takes them), and again, due to scum, you are probably not going to want to put your shoes or feet in there.

I am hoping to have somebody come take them this coming Monday (4/28).  We are busy this weekend and don't have time to deal with the exchange over the weekend.

Let me know which you want and when you can get it.",stuffeby,maybe broken heater) ,Free 4-person hot tub,"It worked up until December, but when I went to turn it on a couple of months ago it didn't get hot (but all the other parts work).
Maybe it's something simple...maybe it needs a whole new heater thing.  Who knows?

I kept telling myself I should get it fixed, but I'd rather just have it gone.  So, it's drained, now, and waiting for a new home.

It's square, and a lovely speckly white/blue fiberglass.  It has a lovely wooden base (so, it's ""above ground""), digital jet / heater / light control, and a lovely vinyl-covered insulated top.

Almost all new jets (and some spares), and you can have all the treatment chemicals and stuff, if you want.

Caveats:
- Bring a truck.  It's a freakin' hot tub.  It's not going to fit into/on your car.
- Bring friends.  I cannot help you load it.  It's probably quite heavy, even with the water out of it.
- Bring straps and whatnot to secure it in the truck you bring.  I don't think gravity is going to cut it.
- First come, first served.  My primary interest is getting this thing out of my back yard.  Hence listing it here, in Free Stuff.  I'll tell you if someone else claims to be ""on the way"", and you're welcome to try to race them here.
- I accept no responsibility if you hurt yourself dealing with this thing.  If you & your pal try to lift it by yourselves and get hernias, I will call 911 for you.  Please note: at that point the hot tub is back up for grabs.  No saving it while you're in the hospital.

Email with any questions you may have and to arrange a time to pick it up.

If you email me with ""is it still available?"" I'll reply ""Yes"".  Because if it wasn't, I'd have deleted this ad.  Duh.

Once we agree on specifics (times, etc), then we will exchange phone numbers.  I'm not handing out my phone number to every random person that emails me, sorry.

I haven't had time to show the desk but I'm going to make a concerted effort in the coming days to make time. 
Description:

My father had an office building in Sausalito and when he retired three of the oak desks from that building (all used by former lawyers), a set of four oak shelves, a locking oak dresser and oak chairs ended up on his home. In order to make space we have decided to let go of one of the desks.  (The other items he's still considering that to do with but you can see them if you come and express your interest if you would like them.) Desk is 65"" wide, 36"" deep and about 30"" tall. It's solid wood. No shoddy particle board! It has a small problem where one of the larger drawers is locked and the drawer above it isn't aligned properly in the track. We never tried fixing this. I can imagine that with a little effort breaking the lock and replacing it shouldn't be too hard, and the drawer above it may just need to be taken out and repositioned. You must be able to move the desk yourself 10 feet roughly to one flight of stairs, up the stairs (we live on a hill so it's one flight below street level) and out the garage. Please make an appiontment to some see the desk or any of my other free items!

RHOPLEX MC-1834P is a low-odor acrylic polymer emulsion designed for modifying Portland cement compositions. It also can be used as a latex bonding agent to enhance adhesion of new concrete to existing concrete. In addition to excellent adhesion, ultraviolet light resistance, water resistance, and increased mortar strength properties, this modifier offers improved sprayability in a low-odor formulation.

RHOPLEX MC-1834P is especially useful for applications with thin sections, excessive vibration and heavy traffic. Applied correctly, this modifier works well on concrete, masonry, brick, wood, glass, metals, and rigid polystyrene and polyurethane foams.

Typical applications

regular and lightweight spray-applied coatings
cement bond coats
traditional trowel-applied stuccos
basement waterproof coatings
general-purpose patching and repair mortars
floor resurfacing and underlayments
terrazzo
heavy-use industrial/commercial cement flooring
binder for certain non-cementitious products (ex: one-package tile grouts)

Performance advantages
increased flexural, tensile and impact strengths
excellent abrasion resistance and adhesion
excellent hardness, toughness and durability
low odor and ammonia-free
longer mortar pot life
improved flow characteristics for spray coat applications
uniform color -- resistant to discoloration from UV light exposure
water resistance
chemical resistance
air-curing at ambient temperature and relative humidity
sediment-free, stable emulsion

Properties
These properties are typical, but they do not constitute specifications.

For Christmas 2003, Abercrombie & Fitch released its most controversial Quarterly yet. It was 280 pages and was subtitled David Abercrombie & Ezra Fitch's Christmas Field Guide. The cover proclaimed in bold letters, ""280 pages of moose, ice hockey, chivalry, group sex and more.""[15] The inside features discussed tips for oral sex and displayed images of group sex and nude young adults frolicking in a river. Included was a letter from the editor which snidely read: ""We don't want much this year, but in keeping with the spirit, we'd like to ask forgiveness from some of the people we've offended over the years....If you'd be so kind, please offer our apologies to the following: the Catholic League, former Lt. Governor Corrine Wood of Illinois, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Stanford University Asian American Association, N.O.W.""[7] The reaction was an unprecedented wave of strong protest.[16] While protest was mounting, a former model revealed that subjects unwilling to go nude were dismissed by Weber and Shahid, and that Weber constantly pressured them to ""act sexier"".[7] A Quarterly contributor remarked, ""They're [A&F;] all about crossing the lines, but this time they drew a line in the sand. They were kind of asking for it.""[7]

On December 9, 2003, Abercrombie & Fitch announced its decision to withdraw the issue and to end the publication, stating that the Christmas issue would be its last.
